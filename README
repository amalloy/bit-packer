# bit-packer

pack: Encode a number into a lazy sequence of digits in base N, with
the most significant digits last

unpack: Perform the reverse operation, decoding a sequence of base-N
digits (most significant digits last) into a single number

Neither of these functions deals with actual characters: in base 16,
the value 10 is the integer '10'. If you want to output in some
particular format, that is left to you; this simply does the mod-N
arithmetic for you.

## Usage

bit-packer.core> (pprint (map #(pack 100 %) (take 15 (drop 2 (range)))))
